			============		DELETE API 		=============
* Used to delete a resource from the database.
	ex - DELETE , dummyurl.com/customer/{id}

* No payload ,neither any query parameter required.
* There are two types of deletion 
	(1.) Hard Delete-

		-- This means to completely wipe off the data from the database.
		-- After this there is no chance to get the data back as it is completely removed from the database.


	(2.) Soft Delete	

		-- This means you will keep a field in the database as  "isDeleted (boolean type)" , so 
		   as soon as we hit delete request we will update this field as true , so in the frontend only the fields with isDeleted false will be shown.
