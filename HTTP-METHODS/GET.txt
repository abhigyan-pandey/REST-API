						==============				GET API 		============== 
* Used to get data from a particular resource.
* Majority content we see on the websites is the result from GET Api only.
* Usually we don't need a request body as we are fetching data from the resource instead 
  of creating one.
* We must use pagination limits and offsets when the returned list is too large.
